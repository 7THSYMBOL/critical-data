   "Bio": "Dr. Mark is Distinguished Professor of Health Sciences and Technology in IMES and EECS at MIT. He received his PhD in electrical engineering from MIT and his MD from Harvard Medical School. He trained in internal medicine at the Harvard Medical Unit at Boston City Hospital and then spent two years in the Medical Corps of the USAF studying the biological effects of laser radiation. He joined the faculty of the EE Department at MIT in 1969 and also the faculty of the Department of Medicine at Harvard Medical School. He has been active in teaching quantitative physiology to undergraduate and graduate engineering students at MIT, and Introduction to Clinical Medicine to HST PhD students. Dr. Mark’s research activities focus on physiological signal processing and database development, cardiovascular modeling, critical care decision support and predictive modeling. His group launched “PhysioNet” in 1999 to provide open access to major collections of well-characterized physiologic and clinical data and associated analytical software. His laboratory’s project, “Critical Care Informatics,” is focused on transforming massive archives of critical care clinical data into new knowledge that will improve the efficiency, accuracy, and timeliness of clinical decision making in intensive care. Dr. Mark’s own research has depended critically on access to physiologic and clinical data, and he is firmly committed to the importance of making such data freely available to the research community."
