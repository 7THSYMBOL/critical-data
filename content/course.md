## 2019.HST.953: Collaborative Data Science in Medicine

*HST.953: Collaborative Data Science in Medicine* is a guide for students who are interested in performing retrospective research using data from electronic health records (Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care [MIMIC] database and eICU Collaborative Research Database [eICU-CRD]). The course covers steps of parsing a clinical question into a study design and methodology for data analysis and interpretation, with emphasis on the data curation process that is required before any analysis can be performed. Understanding and navigating the databases requires working closely with the clinicians who work in intensive care units, and can be much more challenging than the statistics and machine learning tasks. Activities include reviewing case studies from the MIMIC and eICU-CRD databases and a collaborative research project. Student teams will choose a question and clinician to work with for their project. Students will meet weekly with clinician mentors at pre-arranged times. 


### Background

While clinical trials are best in inferring causality, they are not adept at demonstrating small effect size across a population, which is typical given heterogeneity of treatment effect. Moreover, clinical trials typically exclude important subgroups (older patients, those with chronic diseases): findings may not be generalizable to the real-world. Because of the limitations of clinical trials including cost, many practice guidelines are supported by low-quality evidence. To make matters worse, these guidelines are often adopted in countries where funding for research is limited.
The digitalization of healthcare data may provides an opportunity to develop locally relevant practice guidelines rather than adopting those that are based on research on populations that may not generalize to. Digital data is proliferating in diverse forms within the healthcare field, not only because of the adoption of electronic health records, but also because of the growing use of wireless technologies for ambulatory monitoring. Since clinical trials may be too expensive to perform in most countries, digital health data provides an opportunity to conduct locally relevant research. Rigorous observational studies have been shown to correlate well with clinical trials across the medical literature in terms of estimates of risk and effect size. The world is abuzz with applications of machine learning in almost every field – commerce, transportation, banking, and more recently, healthcare. These breakthroughs are due to rediscovered algorithms, powerful computers to run them, and most importantly, the availability of bigger and better data to train the algorithms.

### Course Information

A variety of datasets will be available, including MIMIC-III and Philips eICU from the USA.

### Prerequisites

There are no prerequisites for this course for MIT, Harvard and Wellesley students. For the rest, we require some experience with R, Python and/or SQL.
Everyone is required to complete an online human subjects training (if they haven’t already done so), and sign a Data User Agreement to obtain access to the MIMIC and eICU Collaborative Research Database. This is a project-based course and all the students are required to participate in clinical research using one or both of the databases.

With a strong background in technology, his interest in health sciences began when he picked-up a research project to help the diagnosis of dyslexia in children using mobile applications at his home university.
He went to the United States funded by the Brazil Scientific Mobility Program for a 1-year exchange at Lewis & Clark College and continued his engagement in the health sector as a Visiting Student at the Laboratory for Computational Physiology (LCP) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), helping as Data Scientist in projects to improve healthcare.
Following up his work at MIT, he joined the Big Data initiative at Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein as Data Scientist, working in health science projects and joint initiatives between both institutions.
After two years at Albert Einstein, he re-joined LCP at MIT as a Visiting Engineer to continue his work in the field of Data Science in Healthcare.

            <p>Leo Anthony Celi has practiced medicine in three continents, giving him broad perspectives in healthcare delivery. As clinical research director and principal research scientist at the MIT Laboratory of Computational Physiology (LCP), he brings together clinicians and data scientists to support research using data routinely collected in the intensive care unit (ICU). His group built and maintains the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) database. This public-access database, which now holds clinical data from over 60,000 stays in BIDMC ICUs, has been meticulously de-identified and is freely shared online with the research community. It is an unparalleled research resource; over 4000 investigators from more than 30 countries have free access to the clinical data under a data use agreement. In 2016, LCP partnered with Philips eICU Research Institute to host the eICU database with more than 2 million ICU patients admitted across the United States. The goal is to scale the database globally with contributions from the United Kingdom, France, Spain and Brazil over the next year. 
Leo founded and co-directs Sana, a cross-disciplinary organization based at the Institute for Medical Engineering and Science at MIT, whose objective is to leverage information technology to improve health outcomes in low- and middle-income countries. At its core is an open-source mobile tele-health platform that allows for capture, transmission and archiving of complex medical data (e.g. images, videos, physiologic signals such as ECG, EEG and oto-acoustic emission responses), in addition to patient demographic and clinical information. Sana is the inaugural recipient of both the mHealth (Mobile Health) Alliance Award from the United Nations Foundation and the Wireless Innovation Award from the Vodafone Foundation in 2010. The software has since been implemented around the globe including India, Kenya, Lebanon, Haiti, Mongolia, Uganda, Brazil, Ethiopia, Argentina, and South Africa. 
He is one of the course directors for HST.936 – global health informatics to improve quality of care, and HST.953 – secondary analysis of electronic health records, both at MIT. He is an editor of the textbook for each course, both released under an open access license. The textbook “Secondary Analysis of Electronic Health Records” came out in October 2016 and was downloaded more the 100,000 times in the first ten months of publication. The course “Global Health Informatics to Improve Quality of Care” was launched under edX in February 2017. 
Leo was featured as a designer in the Smithsonian Museum National Design Triennial “Why Design Now?” held at the Cooper-Hewitt Museum in New York City in 2010 for his work in global health informatics. He has spoken in more than 20 countries about the value of data in improving population health.

            <p>Alistair joined the Laboratory for Computational Physiology in 2015 and is currently a full time Research Scientist. He received his B.Eng in Biomedical and Electrical Engineering at McMaster University, Canada, and subsequently read for a D.Phil in Healthcare Innovation at the University of Oxford. His thesis was titled "Mortality and acuity assessment in critical care", and its focus included using machine learning techniques to predict mortality and develop new severity of illness scores for patients admitted to intensive care units. Before joining the LCP, Alistair spent a year as a research assistant at the John Radcliffe hospital in Oxford, where he worked on building early alerting models for patients post-ICU discharge. He has extensive experience and expertise in working with ICU data, and in building decision support tools for critically ill patients. He is actively engaged in research investigations with clinical colleagues. He has worked extensively on creating and releasing the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-III and eICU databases, and in actively supporting its user community.

André Silva completed his MSc degree in Biomedical Engineering at Instituto Superior Técnico in 2015. He is currently working on the application of Machine Learning algorithms in Medicine, with the goal to make sense of medical data and to develop predictive models based on that data to be applied in clinical practice. He uses several data classification models such as bayesian networks and fuzzy modelling in order to explore the effect of several complications on the survivability of patients in the ICU as well as faster and more robust ways of identifying critical events before they happen.
