    Aarhus University is the second largest University in Denmark and affiliated with Aarhus University Hospital as the primary medical teaching hospital. Department of Clinical Medicine is Denmark’s largest health science institute conducting research in almost all medical specialities and hosting a number of different research centres. The local ICU research network is strong and covers many aspects of ICU research. Several researchers are addressing research questions in the ICU area, spanning multicenter RCTs, epidemiological studies based on the highly validated Danish registries, experimental studies in state-of-the-art facilities, and detailed physiologic analysis of captured data in the ICUs, from which particularly the latter has been the foundation for collaboration between LCP and Aarhus University.

    The research in the Biomedical Informatics Group lies at the interface between methods research in Machine Learning & sequence analysis and relevant application areas in biology and medicine. In particular, we develop new learning techniques that are capable of dealing with large amounts of genomic data, allow for very accurate predictions on the phenomenon at hand and are able to comprehensibly provide reasons for their prognoses, and thereby assist in gaining new biomedical insights. In interdisciplinary collaborations, our group has significantly contributed to the understanding of several RNA-dependent regulatory processes including RNA splicing and protein translation. Current research focuses include large-scale Machine Learning, accurate transcriptome reconstruction, identification of RNA-processing regulators, developing clinical decision support systems (based on the analysis of electronic health records (EHR)) and developing methods and resources for international data sharing of genomic and clinical data (for instance, in the development of BRCAExchange.org).

    Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine (KPUM) is one of the oldest medical schools in Japan. The first hospital was founded in 1872 solely from the donation of Kyoto citizens at that time. To maintain top quality medical care in the Kyoto region, the university especially puts emphasis on clinical education. Throughout many years, the university has adapted to the changes in the care needs of the population. At present, KPUM consists of a Medical School, Nursing School, Graduate School for Medical Science, and a Graduate School of Nursing for Health Care Sciences. The students are trained to always have the highest respect for human dignity in addition to specialized knowledge and skills. The Japanese Intensive care PAtient Database (JIPAD) project started at KPUM in 2014 with the support of Japanese Society of Intensive Care Medicine (JSICM) and now includes participating hospitals throughout Japan. JSICM collaborates with the MIT Critical Data group, the National University of Singapore, and the Australian and New Zealand Intensive Care Society.

    IS4 is the Laboratory of Intelligent Systems for Data Analysis, Modeling and Optimization (http://is4.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/), a research group from the Center of Intelligent Systems from IDMEC, Instituto Superior Técnico, Universidade de Lisboa (http://www.idmec.ist.utl.pt/structure_center_intelligent_systems_research.php?page=research). The research activities of the research group are coordinated by João M. Costa Sousa. This research area addresses the development of models and decision support systems based on intelligent methodologies. As data gets big and complex, there is a need for multidisciplinary approaches to transform data into knowledge. This transformation allows analysis, learning, knowledge extraction and modeling in very different domains, including engineering, biomedicine or environment. This research area involves the design of intelligent models and algorithms and the development of decision making models to form classifiers personalized diagnosis, patient treatment systems, and process modeling systems.. It brings together researchers from multi-disciplinary fields with the purpose of advancing knowledge through modeling and optimize data and systems.
