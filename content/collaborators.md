		The National Telehealth Center (NTHC) is one of 12 institutes/centers of the University of the Philippines - National Institutes of Health in Manila, Philippines. Founded in 1998, the NTHC's vision is to be the recognized authority in transformative digital health research and development in the Philippines and Southeast Asia. Under the direction of Dr. Raymond Francis Sarmiento, its mission is to be a centre of excellence in digital health research through innovative, interdisciplinary, and translational methods towards more efficient health care systems. We develop, design, and implement health information systems in the Philippines, as well as conduct monitoring and evaluation projects of digital health solutions. The NTHC is a proud and active member of the Asia eHealth Information Network (AeHIN). It also represents the academe in several national eHealth experts' groups, foremost of which is the Philippine National eHealth Technical Working Group, which provides directions and recommends eHealth strategies to the Philippine National eHealth Steering Committee for nationwide implementation.
